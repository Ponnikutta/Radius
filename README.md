Introduction

    The application allows user to select a range of properties and their related amneties to select with certain exemptions.
    
Features

    This application automatically rejects the selection based on the previous input from user. For example if the user selects Land in the property section then he wont be allowed to select number of rooms.
    
Requirements

    The minimum deployment set for this application is iOS 16.2.
    
Installation

    The application doesn't have any login credentials to access, as this is designed as a single page users can clearly understand from the dashboard screen
    
Architecture

    A detailed JSON response has been clearly segregated based on their models and displayed in a Table view. The architeture pattern follows here is the MVVM, API call has been clearly processed in a seperate class, View has been differntiated for fetching user interactions and View Model connects the data tarnsfer for View and Model. 
    
Dependencies

    No dependencies or third party libraries are used for this application, so that codes wont get affected with future third party updates.
